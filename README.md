lab challenges and doubts
I have started more than 10 times to learn different programming languages. I then turned to python and started again I think like 4 times.
Since I do this as a hoby thing I cannot allow too much time into learning but I am trying.
I will use this repository to study and if I have any doubts to provide a link to people who can help me and explain like I am five :)
